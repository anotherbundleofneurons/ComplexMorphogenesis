# Complex Tissue Morphogenesis Framework

This repository contains a simulation framework for modeling morphogenetic processes in tissue-like structures.
It integrates three conformally-coupled complex Ginzburg–Landau fields (ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃) with:

- **Helfrich-style curvature contributions**
- **Conformal geometry evolution**
- **A dynamic connectivity field modulated by local bending energy**
- **RK4 integration for field updates**
- **Surface embedding for visualization and energy computation**

### Plain-Language Explanation
Multi-layered membrane (spring-mass mesh network) inflated, deflated, cut and sutured/glued depending on constraints set by a liquid crystal (active nematic) system that behaves like an elastic interwoven fiber bundle.
