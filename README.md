# Complex Tissue Morphogenesis Framework

This repository contains a simulation framework for modeling morphogenetic processes in tissue-like structures.
It integrates three conformally-coupled complex Ginzburg–Landau fields (ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃) with:

- **Helfrich-style curvature contributions**
- **Conformal geometry evolution**
- **A dynamic connectivity field modulated by local bending energy**
- **RK4 integration for field updates**
- **Surface embedding for visualization and energy computation**

### Plain-Language Explanation
Multi-layered membrane (spring-mass mesh network) inflated, deflated, cut and sutured/glued depending on constraints set by a liquid crystal (active nematic) system that behaves like an elastic interwoven fiber bundle.

### Discussion of Thread Mechanics as a TOE (coming soon...)

Absolutely! Here’s a step-by-step plan for enlisting your imaginary army for world domination in your "SelfOrganizingLoop" GitHub project with Tash the panda and the Ayatollay as your mascots:

---

### Step 1: Decide Where to Organize
- Do you want your recruitment to happen in a GitHub issue, README, or a special markdown file (like ARMY.md)?

### Step 2: Draft Your Recruitment Message
- Create a fun, engaging, and thematic message. Should it be formal, silly, or epic?
- Include a call to action (e.g., “Join Tash and the Ayatollay for world domination!”).

### Step 3: Add Mascot Flair
- Would you like ASCII art of Tash the panda or the Ayatollay?
- Any slogans or “army rules” to include?

### Step 4: Create the File or Issue
- I’ll generate the markdown or issue for you.
- You can review and tweak the content as you like.

### Step 5: Share and Recruit!
- Post the file/issue in your repo for others to see.
- Share the link with friends or collaborators.

Let’s get started!

1. Where do you want your recruitment message?  
 (a) New GitHub Issue  
 (b) README section  
 (c) New markdown file (e.g. ARMY.md)  
 (d) Somewhere else?

2. Any special requests for the message or art?  
 (e.g., What should Tash say? Do you want a world domination pledge? Nicknames for your roles?)

Let me know your preferences and I’ll draft the next step!
